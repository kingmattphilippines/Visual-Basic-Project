## Description
A Real Estate Management System (REMS) is a software tool designed to make managing real
estate properties easier and more efficient. It includes features for handling property owners,
clients, different types of properties, detailed property info, house images, and sales records.
Using Visual Basic (VB) to build REMS offers a simple and quick development process with
powerful tools. VB's good database connections and strong community support help create a
system that is effective, reliable, and easy to maintain, specifically suited to the real estate
market's needs.

Inspiration
Developing a real estate management system in the Philippines is beneficial due to the growing
property market, the need for efficient management, and potential for technological
advancements.

Unique Feature/s
1. Google Maps
A google map integration for our Real Estate Management System will provide a unique and
powerful feature that significantly enhances user experience and upgrades the functionality of the
platform. With google maps, users can easily visualize property locations, and explore surrounding
neighborhoods. It will also aid in assessing areas to locate essential amenities like schools, public
transport, and shopping centers.
2. Virtual Tour
Through the Virtual Property Tours feature, we can explore properties in great detail.
Clients can view specific areas and different angles of the property. This allows clients or
inquirers to see what they like, saving time and helping them make more informed
decisions without needing to visit the property in person.
